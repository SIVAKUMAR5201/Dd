2.1.1 Data exploration

# Load training data
train = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction/train.csv', dtype={'acoustic_data': np.int16, 'time_to_failure': np.float64})

From the figure it is clear that all the spikes in the time_to_failure (green line) correspond to the spikes in the acoustic_data (blue line).
# Plot the whole training data to get a visual insight

train_acoustic_data_small = train['acoustic_data'].values[::50]
train_time_to_failure_small = train['time_to_failure'].values[::50]

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 8))
plt.title("Trends of acoustic_data and time_to_failure. 2% of data (sampled)")
plt.plot(train_acoustic_data_small, color='b')
ax1.set_ylabel('acoustic_data', color='b')
plt.legend(['acoustic_data'])
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
plt.plot(train_time_to_failure_small, color='g')
ax2.set_ylabel('time_to_failure', color='g')
plt.legend(['time_to_failure'], loc=(0.875, 0.9))
plt.grid(False)

del train_acoustic_data_small
del train_time_to_failure_small


A closer in look at the first earth quake sees a delay between the spike of the acoustic_data and the actual moment of failure.

# Plotting a small portion of the full data to get a more zoomed in look at the first quake
train_acoustic_data_small = train['acoustic_data'].values[:8091455]
train_time_to_failure_small = train['time_to_failure'].values[:8091455]

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 8))
plt.title("Trends of acoustic_data and time_to_failure.")
plt.plot(train_acoustic_data_small, color='b')
ax1.set_ylabel('acoustic_data', color='b')
plt.legend(['acoustic_data'])
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
plt.plot(train_time_to_failure_small, color='g')
ax2.set_ylabel('time_to_failure', color='g')
